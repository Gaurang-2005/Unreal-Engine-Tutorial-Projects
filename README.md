# üéÆ Unreal Engine Tutorial Projects

This repository contains five game development projects I built while completing the [Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer: Learn C++ & Make Video Games](https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealcourse/) course on Udemy. The course offers a hands-on approach to learning Unreal Engine 5 and C++ by guiding students through the creation of multiple games.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This repository only contains the C++ source code (no packaged builds or full project files). You can download and play the final builds on Itch.io using the links below. Also, the first project (Warehouse Wreckage) was built entirely using Blueprints, so its source code is not included.
